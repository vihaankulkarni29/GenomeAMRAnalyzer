I've verified and implemented **every single requirement** from your pipeline specification. Here's the comprehensive implementation status:

---

## **🔍 Stage-by-Stage Implementation Verification**

- Smart handling of assembly vs. individual accessions

**✅ Check: Ensure all accessions are valid, non-empty, and deduplicated**
- Batch file validates accessions before pipeline start
- Robust converter handles deduplication and format validation
- Empty/invalid accessions are logged and skipped

**✅ Error Handling: If a genome fails to download, log and continue**
- Individual accession processing with per-genome error isolation
- Fallback strategies: assembly → individual → query-based
- Comprehensive logging of failures without pipeline halt

### **2. Genome Harvester → CARD Integration** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ Downloaded genomes are run through CARD RGI**
- `run_card_rgi()` processes all downloaded genomes
- Automatic RGI binary detection and installation guidance

**✅ Check: Confirm all FASTA files exist and are non-empty**
- File existence validation before CARD processing
- Size checks to ensure non-empty files
- Clear logging of missing/invalid files

**✅ Error Handling: If CARD fails for a genome, log error, mark status, and continue**
- Per-genome RGI processing with individual error handling
- Missing RGI gracefully handled with warning and continuation
- Detailed success/failure statistics in logs

### **3. CARD Output → FastaAAExtractor** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ Use CARD coordinates to extract user-specified genes/proteins**
- `run_fasta_aa_extractor()` uses CARD results for extraction
- Gene list validation against available CARD output

**✅ Check: Validate gene list against CARD output; warn if any gene is missing**
- Per-genome validation of gene availability
- Missing gene warnings without stopping extraction
- Clear logging of successful vs. failed extractions

**✅ Error Handling: If extraction fails for a gene, log and continue with others**
- Individual gene processing within each genome
- Per-gene error isolation and logging
- Continues with remaining genes/genomes on failure

### **4. FastaAAExtractor → WildTypeAligner** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ Extracted proteins are aligned to reference set**
- `run_wildtype_aligner()` processes all extracted proteins
- Grouped processing by gene type for efficiency

**✅ Check: Ensure reference proteins exist for all user genes**
- Reference file validation in multiple formats (.fasta, .faa)
- Missing reference warnings with clear guidance
- Continues with available references

**✅ Error Handling: If alignment fails, log and continue**
- Per-gene and per-genome alignment error handling
- Detailed statistics on successful vs. failed alignments
- Never halts pipeline for alignment failures

### **5. WildTypeAligner → SubScan** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ SubScan parses alignments for substitutions**
- `run_subscan()` processes all available alignments
- Multiple alignment format support (.txt, .aln, .fasta)

**✅ Check: Validate all alignment files are present and readable**
- File existence, size, and readability validation
- Content validation to ensure non-empty files
- Clear reporting of invalid alignment files

**✅ Error Handling: If parsing fails, log and continue**
- Per-alignment file error handling
- Individual parsing with error isolation
- Comprehensive failure logging and statistics

### **6. SubScan → Mutation Co-occurrence Analyzer** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ Quantifies co-occurrence of mutations across all user-specified proteins**
- `run_cooccurrence()` analyzes mutation patterns
- Statistical significance testing for co-occurrence

**✅ Check: Ensure all mutation records are linked to correct genome/protein**
- Data integrity validation before analysis
- Genome-protein linkage verification
- Minimum data requirements checking

**✅ Error Handling: If analysis fails for a pair, log and continue**
- Graceful handling of insufficient data
- Empty results file generation for consistency
- Never fails pipeline for missing co-occurrence data

### **7. MIC Metadata Harvester** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ Independently collects MIC data for all genomes**
- `run_mic_harvest()` processes all downloaded genomes
- Per-genome MIC data collection with error isolation

**✅ Check: Ensure MIC data is joined to correct genome via biosample/bioproject**
- Genome accession linkage validation
- BioSample connection verification
- Data integrity checks before storage

**✅ Error Handling: If MIC not found, set as missing/null, do not fail**
- Missing MIC treated as normal (common in genomics)
- Per-genome error handling without pipeline failure
- Clear logging of MIC availability statistics

### **8. All Data → HTMLReportGenerator** ✅ COMPLETE
**✅ All results, including MIC and co-occurrence, are passed to the report generator**
- `run_report()` collects all pipeline data
- Comprehensive data gathering from all stages

**✅ Check: Validate all required fields are present in context; warn if missing**
- Data completeness validation before report generation
- Missing data warnings with explanations
- Pipeline summary with success/failure statistics

**✅ Error Handling: If report generation fails, log and output partial report**
- Fallback report generation for partial data
- Minimal report creation even on failures
- Never fails to provide some form of output
