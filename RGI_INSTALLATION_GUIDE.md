CRITICAL SETUP GUIDE: Making the AMR Pipeline Research-Ready
============================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Pipeline completed but produced no research value
- RGI (Resistance Gene Identifier) is ESSENTIAL but not installed
- Without RGI: No protein extraction → No alignments → No mutations → No research insights

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:
"How are antimicrobial resistance genomes developing mutations in specific genes?"

This requires:
1. RGI to find resistance genes and provide coordinates
2. FastaAAExtractor to extract proteins using RGI coordinates  
3. Sequence alignment to identify mutations
4. Mutation co-occurrence analysis for research insights

SOLUTION: Install Proper Bioinformatics Environment
===================================================

STEP 1: Install Miniconda (Required for Bioinformatics Tools)
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
2. Install Miniconda for Windows
3. Restart command prompt/PowerShell

STEP 2: Create Bioinformatics Environment
----------------------------------------
conda create -n amr_analysis python=3.9
conda activate amr_analysis

STEP 3: Install Essential Bioinformatics Tools
---------------------------------------------
# Install RGI (Resistance Gene Identifier) - THE CRITICAL TOOL
conda install -c bioconda rgi

# Install alignment tools
conda install -c bioconda muscle mafft clustalw

# Install additional tools
conda install -c bioconda biopython pandas

STEP 4: Download CARD Database (Required for RGI)
------------------------------------------------
rgi download -d card

STEP 5: Update Pipeline Configuration
-----------------------------------
Update accession_pipeline.yaml:
```yaml
rgi_path: "rgi"  # Will be available after conda install
card_db: "path/to/card.json"  # Downloaded in Step 4
```

STEP 6: Re-run Pipeline with Full Functionality
----------------------------------------------
conda activate amr_analysis
.\run_realworld_pipeline.bat

EXPECTED RESULTS WITH PROPER SETUP:
===================================
✅ 11 genomes downloaded
✅ RGI analysis: resistance gene coordinates identified
✅ Protein extraction: acrB, acrA, tolC proteins extracted from each genome
✅ Sequence alignments: mutations identified across genomes
✅ Co-occurrence analysis: mutation patterns discovered
✅ Research insights: "How resistance genes are mutating"

ALTERNATIVE: Docker-Based Solution
================================
If conda installation is challenging, we can provide a Docker container with:
- Pre-installed RGI, CARD database, alignment tools
- Complete bioinformatics environment
- One-command pipeline execution

CURRENT STATE: Pipeline Infrastructure Complete
==============================================
✅ Robust accession conversion working
✅ Error-tolerant pipeline design working  
✅ All 8 pipeline stages implemented
✅ Professional reporting system working

MISSING: Bioinformatics Tools Installation
==========================================
❌ RGI not installed → No resistance gene detection
❌ CARD database not configured → No gene coordinates
❌ No protein extraction → No research data
❌ No mutation analysis → No research insights

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Install the proper bioinformatics environment following steps above,
then re-run the pipeline to get the research-grade results you need.

The pipeline architecture is production-ready - we just need the tools installed.
