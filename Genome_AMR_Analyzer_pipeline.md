## 🏗️ Current GenomeAMRAnalyzer Pipeline: Step-by-Step

1.  **User Input & Setup**
    -   **What happens:** The user provides either an NCBI search URL or a file of genome accessions, a gene list, and their email.
    -   **Why:** This makes the tool accessible to all users, from clinicians to researchers, with zero setup.
2.  **Genome Download**
    -   **What happens:** The pipeline resolves the NCBI URL or accession list, then downloads the corresponding genome sequences automatically.
    -   **Why:** Ensures the analysis is always performed on the latest, user-specified data.
3.  **Resistance Gene Detection (CARD/AMR Analysis)**
    -   **What happens:** The downloaded genomes are scanned using RGI (or similar) against the CARD database to identify resistance genes and mutations.
    -   **Why:** This is the core of AMR analysis—finding which resistance genes are present and what mutations exist.
4.  **Protein Extraction**
    -   **What happens:** The pipeline extracts protein sequences for the detected resistance genes from the genomes.
    -   **Why:** Enables downstream analyses like alignment, mutation impact, and functional annotation.
5.  **Sequence Alignment (Internal EMBOSS Replacement)**
    -   **What happens:** Extracted proteins are aligned using an internal BioPython-based aligner, producing EMBOSS water-compatible output.
    -   **Why:** Allows for mutation mapping and comparison to wild-type/reference sequences, without external dependencies.
6.  **SubScan & Cooccurrence Analysis**
    -   **What happens:** The pipeline analyzes the alignments for subtypes, mutation patterns, and co-occurrence of resistance genes.
    -   **Why:** Provides deeper insights into resistance mechanisms and potential multi-drug resistance.
7.  **Report Generation**
    -   **What happens:** Results are compiled into an HTML report, CSV summaries, and JSON files.
    -   **Why:** Delivers publication-ready, user-friendly outputs for research, clinical, or surveillance use.
8.  **Zero-Setup Automation**
    -   **What happens:** All dependencies (RGI, CARD, EMBOSS) are installed automatically; users never need to configure anything.
    -   **Why:** Maximizes accessibility and minimizes technical barriers.
9.  **Documentation & Support**
    -   **What happens:** The tool includes simple guides, email templates, and quick-start scripts for all user types.
    -   **Why:** Ensures anyone can use the tool, regardless of technical skill.
